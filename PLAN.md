# PneuVision

## Objective: 
Create a web application that uses machine learning to analyze chest X-rays, detect signs of pneumonia, and provide visual explanations through heatmaps. The goal is to showcase how AI can be applied in healthcare while giving team members hands-on experience with end-to-end software and machine learning development.

## Product Features: 
- Upload chest X-ray images through a simple, responsive interface

- Automated pneumonia predictions generated by a trained ML model

- Visual heatmaps highlighting areas influencing the prediction

- Results dashboard displaying predictions and visual outputs

## Tech Stack:
- Machine Learning & Data: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Grad-CAM for heatmaps

- Backend: Python, Flask

- Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap

## Team Roles: 
- Project Lead: Akshay Sajeev
- Machine Learning Engineers: Srikar Vaddela
- Data Scientist: Austin Santhakumar
- Backend Developer: Charles Doan
- Frontend Developers: Aaliyan Siddiqui, Shriya Peddapuram

## Step Plan:

Week 1: Setup

- Assign roles.

- Set up GitHub repo.

- Set up communication (iMessage/Discord).

Week 2: Research & Planning

- Data scientist: Identify dataset (Kaggle Pneumonia).

- ML engineer: Research baseline model options.

- Frontend: Create wireframes.

- Backend: Plan API routes.

Week 3: Data Prep

- Collect dataset, clean images, normalize sizes.

- Decide on train/val/test split.

- Write preprocessing scripts (NumPy/Pandas/OpenCV).

- Backend sets up a dummy Flask API with placeholder responses for frontend testing.

Week 4: Baseline Model

- Train a simple baseline CNN or use pretrained ResNet/DenseNet with transfer learning.

- Evaluate initial accuracy.

- Document performance results.

- Frontend builds skeleton app with file upload and result placeholder.

Week 5: Improved Model

- Fine-tune model: hyperparameter tuning, augmentations.

- Implement evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1).

- Save/export trained model in a format Flask can load.

Week 6: Backend Integration

- Backend connects Flask API to the trained model.

- Test local inference (upload image → model predicts → API returns result).

- Frontend begins integrating with real API endpoints.

Week 7: Frontend Development

- Build results dashboard (prediction result, confidence score, possibly visualization).

- Improve UI/UX (loading indicators, error handling).

- Connect to backend for live predictions.

Week 8: Model Refinement

- Retrain model with improvements (regularization, dropout, learning rate tuning).

- Compare results to baseline.

- Keep logs for reproducibility.

Week 9: System Testing

- End-to-end testing: upload → prediction → display.

- Check for bugs, slow response times.

Week 10: Optimization

- Optimize model size/speed (pruning, lighter architectures if needed).

- Clean frontend and backend code.

- Improve UI polish.

Week 11: Final Features & Documentation

- Add optional heatmap.

- Write user documentation.

- Prepare project presentation deck.

Week 12: Final Presentation

- Run demo.

- Team presentation.

## Milestones:

1. Baseline Model Trained (Week 4)
2. Full-Stack Prototype (Week 7)
3. Refined Model & Testing (Week 9)
4. Final Presentation (Week 12)
