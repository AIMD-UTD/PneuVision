# PneuVision

## Objective: 
Create a web application that uses machine learning to analyze chest X-rays, detect signs of pneumonia, and provide visual explanations through heatmaps. The goal is to showcase how AI can be applied in healthcare while giving team members hands-on experience with end-to-end software and machine learning development.

## Product Features: 
- Upload chest X-ray images through a simple, responsive interface

- Automated pneumonia predictions generated by a trained ML model

- Visual heatmaps highlighting areas influencing the prediction

- Results dashboard displaying predictions and visual outputs

## Tech Stack:
- Machine Learning & Data: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Grad-CAM for heatmaps

- Backend: Python, Flask

- Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap

## Team Roles: 
- Machine Learning Engineers: Srikar
- Data Specialist: Austin
- Backend Developer: Charles
- Frontend Developers: Aaliyan, Shriya
